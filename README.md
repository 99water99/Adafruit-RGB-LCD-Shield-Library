This is a library for the Adafruit RGB 16x2 LCD Shield 
Pick one up at the Adafruit shop!

This new Adafruit shield makes it easy to use a 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the range of LCDs we stock in the shop, such as our classic <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/181">blue & white</a> as well as the fancy <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/399">RGB negative</a> and <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/398">RGB positive</a>. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then perhaps another 3 to control the RGB backlight for a total of 9 pins. That's half of the pins available on a classic Arduino!
